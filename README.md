For this project I analyzed paid rideshare data on active drivers and historic rides, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

Skills Used: 
* Pandas Library 
* Jupyter Notebook
* Matplotlib library


My objective was to build that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, in addition I produced the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
